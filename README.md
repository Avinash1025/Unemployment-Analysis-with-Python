# 📦 Email Spam Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using natural language processing techniques. It involves text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and classification using multiple machine learning models.


---

## 📌 Objectives

- Load and explore the dataset containing spam/ham email messages.
- Clean and preprocess text data (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.).
- Convert textual data into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- Train machine learning models (e.g., **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**).
- Evaluate the performance using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset (`spam.csv`) contains SMS messages labeled as **'ham'** (not spam) or **'spam'**.  
It includes the following columns:
- `label`: Target variable with values `ham` or `spam`.
- `message`: The actual content of the email/message.
